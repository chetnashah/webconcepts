**A protocol is an interface(collection of methods/abilities), that is these collection of methods a part of type**. 

`Note` - **Protocols can have properties in addition to methods**

This idea of collection of methods as capabilities helps in subtyping/polymorphism.
This is also known as protocol oriented programming.

Protocols are also useful in situations where the class of an object isnâ€™t known, or needs to stay hidden.


subtyping polymorphism help in decoupling/injection.

## Protocol definition/declaration

```objc
@protocol ProtocolName <ParentProtocol>
// list of methods and properties
@end
```

e.g.
In normal case, all methods are considered **required**.
```objc
@protocol XYZPieChartViewDataSource 
- (NSUInteger)numberOfSegments;
- (CGFloat)sizeOfSegmentAtIndex:(NSUInteger)segmentIndex;
- (NSString *)titleForSegmentAtIndex:(NSUInteger)segmentIndex;
@end
```

Protocol with optional and required methods:
```objc
@protocol XYZPieChartViewDataSource
- (NSUInteger)numberOfSegments;
- (CGFloat)sizeOfSegmentAtIndex:(NSUInteger)segmentIndex;
@optional
- (NSString *)titleForSegmentAtIndex:(NSUInteger)segmentIndex;
- (BOOL)shouldExplodeSegmentAtIndex:(NSUInteger)segmentIndex;
@required
- (UIColor *)colorForSegmentAtIndex:(NSUInteger)segmentIndex;
@end
```

## Usage: Object Interface implementing/confirming to a protocol (goes in header file)

```objc
// MyClass extends NSObject and also implements MyProtocol
// Note that protocol confirmation is specified at Interface site.
@interface MyClass : NSObject <MyProtocol, AnotherProtocol, YetAnotherProtocol>
...
@end
```
i.e. `@interface ClassName: ParentClass <ProtocolNamesList>`

## How to refer/have a variable to an object that confirms to a protocol?

Basically we have some object of anytime that confirms to given ProtocolName.
```objc
id <ProtocolName> myVar; // myVar is a variable that convirms to ProtocolName
```

## Protocols can have properties, not just methods.

example::
```objc
@protocol CoordinateSupport <NSObject>
@property double x;
@property double y;
@property double z;
- (NSArray *)arrayFromPosition;
- (double)magnitude;
- (double)getDistanceFromObject:(id <CoordinateSupport>)theObject;
@end
```
