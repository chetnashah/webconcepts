## private and public vars, properties and methods

### MyClass.h (Header File)

```objective-c
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

// Define the interface for MyClass
@interface MyClass : NSObject {
    // Public instance variables
    @public
    NSString *publicInstanceVariable;

    // Private instance variables
    @private
    NSString *privateInstanceVariable;
}

// Public properties
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *publicProperty;

// Public methods
- (void)publicMethod;

@end
```

### MyClass.m (Implementation File)

```objective-c
#import "MyClass.h"

// Define the private interface for MyClass in a class extension
@interface MyClass ()

// Private properties
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *privateProperty;

// Private methods
- (void)privateMethod;

@end

// Implementation of MyClass
@implementation MyClass

// Synthesize properties
@synthesize publicProperty;
@synthesize privateProperty;

// Implement public method
- (void)publicMethod {
    NSLog(@"This is a public method.");
}

// Implement private method
- (void)privateMethod {
    NSLog(@"This is a private method.");
}

@end
```

### main.m (Main File)

```objective-c
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import "MyClass.h"

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];

        // Access public properties and methods
        myObject.publicProperty = @"Public Property Value";
        myObject->publicInstanceVariable = @"Public Instance Variable Value";
        [myObject publicMethod];

        // Attempting to access private properties and methods directly will result in a warning/error
        // myObject.privateProperty = @"Private Property Value"; // Error
        // [myObject privateMethod]; // Error

        // Access private instance variable directly (not recommended)
        // myObject->privateInstanceVariable = @"Private Instance Variable Value"; // Error
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **MyClass.h:**
   - This is the header file where the public interface of the class is declared.
   - Public instance variables, public properties, and public methods are declared here.

2. **MyClass.m:**
   - This is the implementation file where the class implementation is defined.
   - The class extension (`@interface MyClass ()`) is used to declare private properties and methods.
   - The `@implementation MyClass` block contains the implementation of both public and private methods.

3. **main.m:**
   - This is the main file where the application starts.
   - An instance of `MyClass` is created and public properties and methods are accessed.
   - Attempting to access private properties and methods directly will result in a warning or error.

This structure helps to encapsulate the private details of the class and expose only the necessary public interface.


## `@interface` and `@implementation` in a `.m` File - For use case of file level (internal) class implementation

Certainly! You can declare a complete `@interface` block in a `.m` file, **which is often done to define a private class that is only used internally within the implementation file. This is less common but can be useful in certain scenarios. And you don't want to expose class via header files**

### Common Use Cases for Declaring a Complete `@interface` in a `.m` File

1. **Private Helper Classes:**
   - You might declare a helper class that is only used internally by the main class. This keeps the helper class hidden from the public interface.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - By keeping the helper class internal, you can maintain better encapsulation and avoid exposing unnecessary details to the outside world.

### Example

Here's an example demonstrating the use of a complete `@interface` in a `.m` file for a private helper class:

#### MyClass.h (Header File)

```objective-c
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface MyClass : NSObject

// Public properties
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *publicProperty;

// Public methods
- (void)publicMethod;

@end
```

#### MyClass.m (Implementation File)

```objective-c
#import "MyClass.h"

// Private helper class declared within the .m file
@interface HelperClass : NSObject

// Private properties
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *helperProperty;

// Private methods
- (void)helperMethod;

@end

@implementation HelperClass

// Implement private method
- (void)helperMethod {
    NSLog(@"This is a helper method.");
}

@end

@implementation MyClass

// Synthesize public properties
@synthesize publicProperty = _publicProperty;

// Implement public method
- (void)publicMethod {
    NSLog(@"This is a public method.");

    // Create an instance of the private helper class
    HelperClass *helper = [[HelperClass alloc] init];
    helper.helperProperty = @"Helper Property Value";
    [helper helperMethod];
}

@end
```

### Explanation

- **MyClass.h:**
  - This file contains the public interface of the main class, including public properties and methods.

- **MyClass.m:**
  - This file contains the complete `@interface` block for the `HelperClass`, which is declared and implemented within the `.m` file.
  - The `HelperClass` is used internally by `MyClass` and is not exposed in the public header file.
  - The implementation of `MyClass` includes the use of the `HelperClass`.

### Benefits

- **Encapsulation:** The `HelperClass` is encapsulated within the `.m` file, making it private to the implementation.
- **Clean Public Interface:** The public header file remains clean and only exposes what is necessary for external use.
- **Code Organization:** Helper classes that are only used internally can be kept within the implementation file, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.

By declaring a complete `@interface` block in the `.m` file, you can create internal helper classes that are not exposed to the outside world, thus maintaining better encapsulation and organization.
