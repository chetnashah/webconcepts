## UISplitViewController 
 
It is an example of 

A split view controller is a container view controller that manages child view controllers in a hierarchical interface. In this type of interface, changes in one view controller drive changes in the content of another.

Split view interfaces are most suitable for filterable content or navigating content hierarchies, like traversing the folders and notes within the Notes app to view each note

When you build your app’s user interface, the split view controller is typically the root view controller of your app’s window. 

**The split view controller has no significant appearance of its own. Most of its appearance is defined by the child view controllers you install**
