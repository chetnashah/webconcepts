## Core graphics

https://github.com/jrasmusson/swift-arcade/tree/master/Animation/CoreGraphicsIntro

Everything in coregraphics is driven by `context`i.e. `let ctx = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()` in a `ViewController, draw method`, think of this equivalent to `Paint/Canvas` state holder in other UI frameworks.
