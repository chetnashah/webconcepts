## Modally show sheet from bottom based on a "bindable boolean"

# The `.sheet` modifier in SwiftUI  
Everything you need to know—placement rules, overloads, lifecycle, options, and gotchas.

---

## 1. What exactly is a “sheet”?

* A modal view that **slides up from the bottom** on iOS / iPadOS (and appears as a window on macOS or a pop-over on tvOS / watchOS).  
* While shown, the underlying view hierarchy stays in memory but is *inactive*.  
* Only **one sheet can be presented per window at a time**; a new one replaces the existing presentation.

---

## 2. Overloads you can use

```swift
.sheet(isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
       onDismiss: (() -> Void)? = nil) { Content }

.sheet(item: Binding<Item?>,
       onDismiss: (() -> Void)? = nil) { Item in Content }
       where Item : Identifiable
```

Key differences:

* `isPresented` → binary flag, you must toggle it back to `false`.  
* `item` → value-driven; the system sets the binding back to `nil` automatically when the sheet vanishes.

---

## 3. Where should I attach `.sheet`?

You *can* add it to **any** view, but the **best practice** is:

1. Attach it to a **stable ancestor** that is guaranteed to remain in the hierarchy for the whole time the sheet might be visible—usually the **root container** of the screen:
   ```swift
   NavigationStack {        // good anchor point
       ContentView()
   }
   .sheet(…)
   ```
2. Attaching to a short-lived child can cause:
   • “Attempt to present already presenting view controller” warnings  
   • The sheet to dismiss unexpectedly when the child is removed (List cell reload, conditional `if` view, etc.).

If multiple ancestors define a `.sheet`, the **closest one in the view tree wins**.

---

## 4. Typical usage patterns

### 4.1 Boolean flag

```swift
struct DetailButton: View {
    @State private var showForm = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Add item") { showForm = true }
            .sheet(isPresented: $showForm) {
                FormView()
            }
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Item-driven sheet

```swift
struct ProductList: View {
    @State private var selected: Product?

    var body: some View {
        List(products) { product in
            Text(product.name)
                .onTapGesture { selected = product }
        }
        .sheet(item: $selected) { product in
            ProductDetail(product: product)
        }
    }
}
```
`selected` is reset to `nil` automatically when the sheet goes away.

### 4.3 Programmatic dismissal from inside

```swift
struct Modal: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Settings")
            Button("Done") { dismiss() }
        }
        .interactiveDismissDisabled()     // optional
    }
}
```

---

## 5. Extra presentation APIs (iOS 16+)

```swift
.sheet(…) {
    Content()
        .presentationDetents([.medium, .large])
        .presentationDragIndicator(.visible)
        .interactiveDismissDisabled(false)
}
```

* **Detents** – control sheet height.  
* **Drag indicator** – small handle at the top.  
* **interactiveDismissDisabled** – block swipe-down to force an explicit “Close”.

---

## 6. Lifecycle & environment

* `.onAppear` of sheet content = sheet just became visible.  
* `onDismiss` closure of the modifier is invoked **after** the sheet disappears on screen.  
* The sheet inherits all `@Environment` values from the view it’s attached to; if that view vanishes, the sheet keeps a snapshot.

---

## 7. Common pitfalls

1. **Mutating state of a hashed value**  
   If the anchor view sits inside a `List`/`ForEach` driven by `Identifiable` data, updating that data can re-create the row and break the presentation.  
   ➜ Attach the sheet higher or mark the row’s `id` as `constant`.

2. **Multiple sheets on the same view**  
   Only the *first*‐declared `.sheet` runs. Compose logic into one modifier or use `.sheet`, `.popover`, `.alert` separately.

3. **Attempted nested modals**  
   Showing a sheet from within an already-displayed sheet works, but avoid deep nesting (poor UX) and prefer `NavigationStack` inside the modal.

4. **Memory leaks by retaining self**  
   Don’t capture `self` strongly in `onDismiss`; use `[weak self]` if referring to classes.

---

## 8. Relationship to other presentation modifiers

* `.popover` – anchored to a specific rect on iPad / Mac.  
* `.fullScreenCover` – covers entire screen; no detents.  
* `.alert`, `.confirmationDialog` – transient, smaller UI.  
Pick the one that matches the platform UX guidelines.

---

## 9. Quick checklist (TL;DR)

• Prefer placing `.sheet` on the screen’s root container.  
• Use the **item** variant for simpler state management.  
• Employ `@Environment(\.dismiss)` inside the sheet to close it.  
• Configure height with `presentationDetents` (iOS 16+).  
• Only one sheet at a time; additional calls are ignored until the current one is dismissed.  
• Avoid mutating the identity of the presenting view while the sheet is onscreen.  
• Test on iPad & Mac—sheet behaves differently across size classes.
