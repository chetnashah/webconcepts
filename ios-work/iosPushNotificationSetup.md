An iOS **Push Certificate is required** for push notification delivery to all iOS mobile apps.


## Capabilities and entitlements

### Adding Push notification capability

A capability grants your app access to an app service that Apple provides, such as CloudKit, Game Center, or In-App Purchase. To use some app services, you must provision your app, adding a capability with Xcodeâ€™s project editor that configures the app service correctly for you.
