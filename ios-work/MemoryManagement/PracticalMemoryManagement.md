## Swift and ARC

https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10216/

Object lifetime begins at initialisaition and ends at last use of the reference.
retain count is 1 on a initialized object, and does not require explicit retain.
A retain is inserted before a refernce assignment, and a release is inserted after last use. (contrast to deallocation on scope end like C++).

Relying on observed object lifetimes can cause bugs!

* Weak and unowned references in reference counting.

## Weak references

**the object with the delegate should not retain its delegate, management/owning of the delegate is not the delegators responsibility, and must be weakly held by delegator. The real owner of a delegate is only the entity registering the delegate**

Typically in observer pattern, the source/observable has a larger object lifecycle than the observers, and observers/delegates must be weakly held.

The other alternative is to **kill the link between observer/observable by explicit unregistration on destruction of object with shorter lifetime**, assuming we have a way to know that.

### Listeners/notification delegates held by notification centers are weak references

**assigning delegates the 'assign' property vs 'retain'. Delegators should not retain delegates**

The reason that you avoid retaining delegates is that you need to avoid a retain cycle:
1. A creates B A sets itself as B's delegate â€¦ A is released by its owner
2. If B had retained A, A wouldn't be released, as B owns A, thus A's dealloc would never get called, causing both A and B to leak.
3. You shouldn't worry about A going away because it owns B and thus gets rid of it in dealloc.

object sending the delegate messages does not own the delegate.
**Under ARC you should use `weak` instead of `assign`**


### Delegates held by delegators should be weak references

The weak reference enforces the concept that the management of the delegate is not the delegators responsibility.
