## FileManager (NSFileManager in Objective C)

You use it to locate, create, copy, and move files and directories. You also use it to get information about a file or directory or change some of its attributes.


### Delegate for FileManager events

If you are moving, copying, linking, or removing files or directories, you can use a delegate in conjunction with a file manager object to manage those operations. The delegateâ€™s role is to affirm the operation and to decide whether to proceed when errors occur. In macOS 10.7 and later, the delegate must conform to the `FileManagerDelegate` protocol.

is divided into the following directories:
1. `Documents` - to store user-generated content.
2. `Library` - to store app files that should not be exposed to user.
3. `tmp` - for temporary files. The system periodically purges these files.
