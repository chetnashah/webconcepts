This is a react-native(0.67.3) project and the task will be to emulate a structure of trello. There are 2 columns that stretch along the device height and contain cards with a number on it.

A basic structure is present which can be altered as you like. Following is the list of tasks which you will need to perform. You are required to complete as many as you can within an approx time of 1 hour.

1. Card addition
Add the functionality for the `Add` button where on clicking the button for the particular column, a card is added with a number signifying its position when added. Cards can be added only till there is space in the column. Once the column is filled the button needs to be disabled with some style marker.

2. Toggle label
By tapping on the card the color of the label can change. User can switch between any 5-10 label colors/no label by tapping on it repeatedly.

3. Add More Columns
User has a button available to add more column each having all the same features as above

4. Moving Card in column
Users can drag a card in the column up and down. The card can be dropped in between other cards but the number on it will not change.
