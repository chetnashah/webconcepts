## What is Identity, and why is it needed?

Two coworkers, Jim and Sharon, may be able to recognize each other by sight. But a computer does not know who "Jim" is or who "Sharon" is. 

A computer instead stores a separate user profile for Jim and Sharon, which includes a name, a set of facts about their identity, and a set of privileges

## who has a digital identity?

Almost every person who uses computers or accesses the Internet today has some form of digital identity.

That may be an email address and password combination, a biometric or identifying characteristics stored in an identity and access management (IAM) system.

### computer identity

Computers and computing devices have a form of identity as well. Networking systems and protocols use several different methods to identify these devices; for instance, many systems use IP addresses or MAC addresses for this purpose. Organizations also have stored characteristics that allow external systems to recognize and interact with them


## What is authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying identity. Access control systems check one or more characteristics of users or devices in order to authenticate them.

There are three main characteristics or "factors" that authentication can assess:

1. Knowledge (**Something they know**): This authentication factor is something the user knows: for example, entering a password or answering a security question (e.g. "What is your mother's maiden name?"). Some services, such as banks and credit bureaus, may also prompt their customers to provide additional personal information, like their mailing address or government identification number, to verify their identity.
2. Possession (**Something they have**): This authentication factor is something the user has â€” in other words, it involves checking if the user possesses an assigned physical or digital token. For instance, a system may send a verification code to a user's smartphone to check that they possess the phone, or it may ask the user to plug a hardware token into their USB port.
3. Inherent qualities(**Something they are**): This authentication factor is something the user is; it checks qualities that are natural to the user. Examples include retina scans, facial recognition, and voice recognition.
