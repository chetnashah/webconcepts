## What is Identity Provider?

An identity provider (IdP) stores and manages users' digital identities. Think of an IdP as being like a guest list, but for digital and cloud-hosted applications instead of an event. An IdP may check user identities via username-password combinations and other factors, or it may simply provide a list of user identities that another service provider (like an SSO) checks.

IdPs are not limited to verifying human users. Technically, an IdP can authenticate any entity connected to a network or a system, including computers and other devices. Any entity stored by an IdP is known as a "principal" (instead of a "user").

## How does an IdP verify user identity?

Digital user identity is associated with quantifiable factors that can be verified by a computer system. These factors are called "authentication factors." The three authentication factors are:

1. Knowledge: something you know, such as a username and password
2. Possession: something you have, such as a smartphone
3. Intrinsic qualities: something you are, such as your fingerprint or a retina scan
An IdP may use one or more of these factors to identify a user
