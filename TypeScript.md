Use //ts-check
for type checking in any file.

### Role of tsconfig.json

It is a configuration file generated by `tsc --init`.
It tells typescript how your project is supposed to be processed.


### Useful tsconfig options

* strictNullChecks - Usually keep this true to keep all types seperate, If you want a variable to hold null value, you will have to explicitly specify it in type.

* noEmitOnError - If typescript error is found, i.e. compiler reports an error, code is not compiled. i.e. js files are not created.

* sourceMap - setting this to true creates .js.map files along with .js, helping us in debugging ts code as well.

* noImplicityAny - If set to true, will set type of unininitialized variables implicitly to "any".





### How type-checkers usually work

They start with values/atoms like numbers, strings booleans  etc. and operations like *, + etc. and flow the types into variables in such a way that a constraint satisfaction problem is solved, and the most general type is given to variables that are not directly connected to values.
