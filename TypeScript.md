Typescript is an os-level install usually since it is a compiler, so installed by `npm install -g typescript` flag, and does not appear in project dependencies.

**Note** - when using typescript with webpack it is better idea to keep a local copy of typescript, also webpack uses typescript-loader to do the work.

Use //ts-check
for type checking in any file.

### Role of tsconfig.json

It is a configuration file generated by `tsc --init`.
It tells typescript how your project is supposed to be processed.

### A crude way to bundle .ts files together

```sh
tsc --outfile bundle.js f1.ts f2.ts f3.ts // order matters
```

### Useful tsconfig options

* strictNullChecks - Usually keep this true to keep all types seperate, If you want a variable to hold null value, you will have to explicitly specify it in type.

* noEmitOnError - If typescript error is found, i.e. compiler reports an error, code is not compiled. i.e. js files are not created.

* sourceMap - setting this to true creates .js.map files along with .js, helping us in debugging ts code as well.

* noImplicityAny - If set to true, will set type of unininitialized variables implicitly to "any".

### What to compile ?

1. explicitly specify via `files`: telling to compile only given list.

2. `exclude`: compile everything except what is present in exclude value.

**Note** - when compiling a single file specified at sh/cmd e.g. `tsc app.ts` instead of `tsc`, the tsconfig.json does not come into picture, you have to use command line flags to achieve a similar effect.

### What are typescript definition files ?

Typescript definition files i.e. `filename.d.ts` are typically a translation layer between simple Javsascript library/projects without types to an interface that provides types to the user of the library.
 Helps IDEs and language services with autocompletion and type checking.
 The repository DefinitelyTyped on github contains typescript definition files for all well known projects.

### @types - npm level access to definitely typed repo
used post-2.0 typescript, save types as a dependency, ends up in node_modules.
`npm install --save-dev @types/jquery`

### typings - the types package manager
Used pre-2.0 typescript
`typings install` installs types in a `typings` folder at project level dir.
`typings.json` is the config file for type management.

### How type-checkers usually work

They start with values/atoms like numbers, strings booleans  etc. and operations like *, + etc. and flow the types into variables in such a way that a constraint satisfaction problem is solved, and the most general type is given to variables that are not directly connected to values.

### Typescript "declare" keyword

var creates a new variable. declare is used to tell TypeScript that the variable has been created elsewhere. If you use declare, nothing is added to the JavaScript that is generated - it is simply a hint to the compiler.

For example, if you use an external script that defines var externalModule, you would use declare var externalModule to hint to the TypeScript compiler that externalModule has already been set up
