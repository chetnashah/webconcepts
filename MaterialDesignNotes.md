### Lights

Key lights create directional shadows, and ambient light create soft shadows.

### Material

#### Material charechteristics

1. Opaque
2. occupies unique points in space.
3. mutable shape
4. changes in size only along its plane.
5. can join to other material
6. can seperate or split.
7. can be created or destroyed.
8. moves along any axis

### Physical properties

Material has varying x & y dimensions, but always has uniform thicknes i.e. 1dp. NotE: content does not add thickness to material. A material can display any shape or color.

Content can behave independently of material but within the bounds of the material.

Since material is solid, input events cannot pass through it.

Multiple material elements cannot occupy same point in space simultaniously, Using elevation to separate material elements is one method of preventing multiple material elements from occupying the same point in space simultaneously.

When changing elevation of a material - Material cannot pass through another material (it is solid - remember?)

Material can change shape, but only along its plane.

Material never bends or folds.

Material can split and become whole again.

Z-axis motion is prompted by user interaction.


#### Shadows

Shadows are created by relative elevation.
