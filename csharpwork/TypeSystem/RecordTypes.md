**Records are for immutable data structures**. They are a new feature in C# 9.0 that allows you to create classes and structs with built-in functionality for value-based equality, immutability, and concise syntax.

Records are of two types:
1. **Record Class (Reference types)**: A reference type that provides built-in functionality for value-based equality, immutability, and concise syntax.
2. **Record Struct (Value types)**: A value type that provides similar functionality to record classes but is stored on the stack, making it more efficient for small data structures.
