# .NET Deployment Models (Revised Explanation)

## 1. **Framework-Dependent Deployment (FDD)**

- **What is it?**  
  Your app's output is a DLL (`MyApp.dll`). To run, you need the .NET runtime installed, and you **start your app using the `dotnet` CLI**.

- **How to run:**  
  ```bash
  dotnet MyApp.dll
  ```

- **Needs .NET installed:** Yes (runtime only, not SDK)
- **Needs dotnet CLI:** Yes, for launching the app.

---

## 2. **Framework-Dependent Executable (FDE)**

- **What is it?**  
  This model **produces a platform-specific executable** (like `MyApp.exe` for Windows).  
  The produced executable **is a launcher** that finds the right .NET runtime and starts your app.

- **How to run:**  
  Double-click `MyApp.exe` (Windows) or run from the terminal (`./MyApp` on Linux/macOS).

- **Needs .NET installed:** Yes (runtime only, not SDK)
- **Needs dotnet CLI:** **No!**  
  The `dotnet` command is **not needed** to launch the app. The executable does the work of finding the runtime and starting your app.

- **Under the hood:**  
  The executable serves as a native "host"â€”it knows how to find the required .NET runtime and then runs your app DLL with it.

## 3. **Self-contained Deployment**

- **What is it?**  
  Your app (and a copy of the .NET runtime) are bundled together.  
  **No .NET installation is needed on the target machine.**

- **How to run:**  
  Double-click `MyApp.exe` (Windows) or run from terminal (`./MyApp`).

- **Needs .NET installed:** No
- **Needs dotnet CLI:** No

## **Comparison Table (Revised)**

| Model                     | Needs .NET installed?   | Needs `dotnet` CLI to run? | Output                    | How to run                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Framework-Dependent (FDD) | Yes (.NET runtime)     | **Yes**                    | `MyApp.dll`               | `dotnet MyApp.dll`                 |
| Framework-Dependent Exec  | Yes (.NET runtime)     | **No**                     | `MyApp.exe` + `MyApp.dll` | Double-click or `./MyApp.exe`      |
| Self-contained            | **No**                 | **No**                     | `MyApp.exe` + runtime     | Double-click or `./MyApp.exe`      |

## **Summary of the Key Points**
- **FDD**: Produces a DLL. Requires the `dotnet` command to launch.
- **FDE**: Produces an OS-native executable. **Does NOT require the `dotnet` CLI**; just run the `.exe` or platform equivalent. Still needs .NET runtime installed.
- **Self-contained**: Also produces an OS-native executable, but brings its own runtime. No .NET install needed.
