## What is a Namespace?

A namespace is the address of a type. Namespaces are a mechanism to uniquely identify a type by requiring a full address, rather than just a short name.

## Assembly and Namespace Relationship

There is not always a one-to-one mapping between assemblies and namespaces. A single assembly can contain many namespaces, and a namespace can be defined in many assemblies. However, it is common to have a namespace that matches the assembly name.
