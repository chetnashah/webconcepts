`Host` and `HostApplicationBuilder` are part of the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting namespace, which is used to create and configure host applications in .NET. The `Host` class provides a way to set up and run applications, while `HostApplicationBuilder` is a builder for creating a host application.

`Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` provides infrastructure for hosting applications (like setting up configuration, logging, and dependency injection), while `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` is focused solely on dependency injection (DI) services and service provider creation.

In your code, `HostApplicationBuilder` and `Host` are part of the hosting infrastructure, which uses the DI container from `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` under the hood. Use `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` for building and running applications, and `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` when you only need DI.
