## The .NET Ecosystem: Background

### 1. **.NET Framework**
- **Released:** 2002
- **Platform:** Windows-only, mature, closed-source (until later releases)
- **Use:** Desktop apps (WinForms, WPF), ASP.NET web apps, enterprise applications  
- **Limitation:** Tied to Windows, slow to evolve, fragmentation issues

### 2. **.NET Core**
- **Released:** 2016
- **Platform:** Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS), open-source
- **Use:** Web APIs, cloud applications, console apps  
- **Advantage:** Modern, modular, side-by-side deployments, fast releases

### 3. **The Problem: Fragmentation**
- **.NET Framework** and **.NET Core** were **not fully compatible**.
- **Portable Class Libraries (PCLs)** tried to share code, but were awkward and limited.
- Developers faced **"Can I use this library?"** headaches between frameworks.

---

## Enter **.NET Standard** (2016)

### **What is .NET Standard?**
- **A specification, NOT a runtime.**
- Defines a **set of APIs** that all .NET implementations (Framework, Core, Xamarin, Unity, etc.) must implement for a given version.
- **Goal:** Make code/libraries compatible across all .NET platforms.

### **How Did It Work?**
- **You target .NET Standard** in your class library.
- Any app or platform supporting that .NET Standard version **can use your library**.

#### Example:

| .NET Standard Version | Supported By (examples)              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1.0                  | .NET Core 1.0, .NET Framework 4.5    |
| 2.0                  | .NET Core 2.0, .NET Framework 4.6.1  |
| 2.1                  | .NET Core 2.1+, Xamarin              |

- **Higher .NET Standard = More APIs, Fewer Platforms**
- **Lower .NET Standard = Fewer APIs, More Platforms**

---

## **Why Was .NET Standard Needed?**

- **Unified Library Ecosystem:** Write once, use everywhere.
- **Reduces duplication:** No more separate libraries for each .NET variant.
- **Simplifies NuGet packaging and reuse.**

---

## **How Did It Work in Practice?**

- **Class libraries** targeted `.NET Standard`.
- **Applications** (console, web, desktop) targeted a runtime (.NET Framework, .NET Core) that supported that .NET Standard.
- **NuGet** enforced compatibility, so no more runtime surprises.

---

## **Evolution: .NET 5+ and the End of .NET Standard**

- **.NET 5 (2020) and later (including .NET 6, 7, 8):**
    - **Unifies** .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin/Mono into **single platform**: called just **.NET** (.NET 5+).
    - No longer need .NET Standard for new projects.
    - **Multi-targeting** via `net5.0`, `net6.0`, etc.
    - **.NET Standard is still supported** for legacy sharing, but **not evolving**.

## **Summary Table**

| Era            | Sharing Mechanism        | Notes                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| .NET Framework | PCLs, manual            | Painful, limited                       |
| .NET Core 1-3  | **.NET Standard**       | Gold standard for cross-platform libs  |
| .NET 5+        | Target unified .NET     | Use `net5.0`, `net6.0`, etc.           |

---

## **Practical Guidance for Today**

- **New libraries:** Target the lowest .NET version you need (e.g., `net6.0`), unless you must support old .NET Framework, then use `.NET Standard 2.0`.
- **Existing shared libraries:** If you need both old .NET Framework and new .NET Core/.NET, multi-target with `.NET Standard 2.0` and `net6.0`.
- **Day-to-day:**  
    - For new code, you rarely need `.NET Standard`.
    - For legacy support, `.NET Standard 2.0` is the “sweet spot” for maximum compatibility.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- **.NET Standard** was crucial for code sharing across .NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin, etc.
- **.NET 5+** unifies the ecosystem; **multi-targeting** is now preferred.
- **Understand project targets** to ensure compatibility for apps and libraries.
- **.NET Standard** is still relevant for libraries needing to support older platforms, but for new projects, just target the required .NET runtime.

---

**In summary:**  
>.NET Standard was the bridge that enabled code sharing and compatibility across the fractured .NET world. With .NET 5 and beyond, the ecosystem is unified, and .NET Standard is mostly for backward compatibility.
