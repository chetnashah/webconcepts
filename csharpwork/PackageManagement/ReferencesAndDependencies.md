## Dependencies (is the new term), previously known as References

In a C# `.csproj` file (used by Visual Studio and .NET), **references** and **dependencies** serve related but distinct purposes. Here's when you see each:

### **References**
- **What are they?** References point to external assemblies (DLLs or EXEs) that your project needs to compile and run. These are typically managed via `<Reference>` elements in older `.csproj` formats or implicitly through other mechanisms in modern SDK-style projects.
- **When do you see them?**
  - In **older .NET Framework projects** (non-SDK-style `.csproj` files), you explicitly see `<Reference>` elements listing specific assemblies, e.g.:
    ```xml
    <Reference Include="System.Core" />
    <Reference Include="MyCustomLibrary, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null">
      <HintPath>..\lib\MyCustomLibrary.dll</HintPath>
    </Reference>
    ```
  - When you manually add a reference to a specific DLL (e.g., via "Add Reference" in Visual Studio) that isn't managed by NuGet or another package system.
  - For **direct assembly references** not sourced from NuGet packages or project references.
- **Context**: Common in legacy .NET Framework projects or when referencing local DLLs not packaged as NuGet packages.

### **Dependencies**
- **What are they?** Dependencies are broader and include anything your project relies on, such as NuGet packages, other projects, or frameworks. In modern SDK-style `.csproj` files, dependencies are often managed via `<PackageReference>` for NuGet packages or `<ProjectReference>` for other projects.
- **When do you see them?**
  - In **modern SDK-style .csproj files** (used by .NET Core, .NET 5+), you see:
    - **NuGet package dependencies** listed as `<PackageReference>`:
      ```xml
      <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
      </ItemGroup>
      ```
    - **Project references** to other C# projects in the solution:
      ```xml
      <ItemGroup>
        <ProjectReference Include="..\MyOtherProject\MyOtherProject.csproj" />
      </ItemGroup>
      ```
    - **Framework dependencies** implicitly included via the `<TargetFramework>` or `<TargetFrameworks>` element (e.g., `net8.0`), which pulls in the .NET runtime and base libraries without explicit `<Reference>` entries.
  - In Visual Studioâ€™s **Solution Explorer**, under the "Dependencies" node, which groups:
    - **NuGet packages** (from `<PackageReference>`).
    - **Projects** (from `<ProjectReference>`).
    - **Frameworks** or SDKs (e.g., .NET 8.0).
    - **Analyzer packages** (e.g., Roslyn analyzers from NuGet).
  - In **lock files** like `packages.lock.json` or `assets.json`, which detail resolved dependency versions.
- **Context**: Common in .NET Core/.NET 5+ projects, where NuGet and project references dominate, and direct assembly references are rare.

### **Key Differences**
| Aspect               | References                              | Dependencies                           |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Scope**            | Specific to assemblies (DLLs/EXEs).    | Broader: NuGet, projects, frameworks. |
| **File Representation** | `<Reference>` in old `.csproj`.       | `<PackageReference>`, `<ProjectReference>` in SDK-style `.csproj`. |
| **Common in**        | .NET Framework, manual DLL refs.       | .NET Core, .NET 5+, NuGet-based projects. |
| **Management**       | Manual or via Visual Studio UI.        | Managed via NuGet, SDK, or project refs. |
| **Visibility**       | In old `.csproj` or "References" node. | In "Dependencies" node in Solution Explorer or modern `.csproj`. |

### **Why the Distinction?**
- **References** are lower-level, focusing on specific compiled binaries.
- **Dependencies** are higher-level, encompassing packages, projects, and frameworks, with modern .NET leaning heavily on NuGet for modularity and version management.
- In modern SDK-style projects, you rarely see `<Reference>` because NuGet packages and project references handle most dependencies, and the SDK implicitly includes framework assemblies.

### **Practical Notes**
- **NuGet vs. Manual References**: Prefer NuGet packages (`<PackageReference>`) over manual DLL references (`<Reference>`) for better version management and reproducibility.
- **Solution Explorer**: In Visual Studio, the "Dependencies" node consolidates all dependency types, while older projects may show a "References" node for assembly references.
- **Migration**: If moving from .NET Framework to .NET Core/5+, expect to replace many `<Reference>` entries with `<PackageReference>` or `<ProjectReference>`.
