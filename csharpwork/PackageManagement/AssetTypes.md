# **NuGet Package Asset Types — Quick Reference**

| Asset Type      | What It Is                       | Example(s)                                                                                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **runtime**     | Main code/libraries you use      | The `.dll` files that your app executes at runtime.                                          |
| **build**       | MSBuild scripts                  | `.targets` or `.props` files that modify the build process.                                  |
| **native**      | Native/unmanaged code            | `.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib` files (e.g., C/C++ libraries) your app may call into.             |
| **contentfiles**| Files added to your project      | Config files, templates, images, or static assets copied to your project.                    |
| **analyzers**   | Code analysis tools              | Roslyn analyzers that give warnings or suggestions as you type or build.                     |
| **buildtransitive** | Build logic for consumers    | MSBuild files that apply not just to your project, but also to any project referencing it.   |

## **1. runtime**

- **What:** The main compiled code (.dll) you use in your program.
- **Example:**  
  - `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` is included when you reference the Newtonsoft.Json package.
- **Use case:**  
  - When your code uses `using Newtonsoft.Json;`, it needs this runtime asset to work.

---

## **2. build**

- **What:** Special MSBuild files that change how your project is built.
- **Example:**  
  - A package includes a `build/MyPackage.targets` file that adds custom build steps (e.g., code generation).
- **Use case:**  
  - Source generator packages often use this to run during build.

---

## **3. native**

- **What:** Pre-built platform-specific libraries (not managed .NET code).
- **Example:**  
  - A package provides `native/x64/MyNativeLibrary.dll` for Windows, or `.so` for Linux.
- **Use case:**  
  - Packages that wrap hardware drivers, video processing, or encryption libraries.

---

## **4. contentfiles**

- **What:** Files (not code) that get copied into your project when you add the package.
- **Example:**  
  - A package gives you a sample `appsettings.json`, an image, or a code template.
- **Use case:**  
  - UI component libraries might include CSS or static files as content.

---

## **5. analyzers**

- **What:** Roslyn code analyzers that run during development/build to warn about code issues.
- **Example:**  
  - A package provides an analyzer that warns you if you forget to check a method’s return value.
- **Use case:**  
  - StyleCop.Analyzers package — helps you follow coding style guidelines.

---

## **6. buildtransitive**

- **What:** MSBuild logic that flows through your project to projects that depend on it.
- **Example:**  
  - Package A includes a `buildTransitive/A.targets` file. If Project B references Project A, B also gets those build steps.
- **Use case:**  
  - Shared source generator logic, code contracts, or global settings.

# **When to Care?**

- **You want only code, not analyzers or content?**  
  Use: `<IncludeAssets>runtime</IncludeAssets>`
- **You want analyzers for dev, but not for consumers of your library?**  
  Use: `<PrivateAssets>analyzers</PrivateAssets>`
