## What is a **"Navigation Property"** in C# / EF Core?

**Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET. It lets you work with databases using C# classes.

### **Navigation Property (in EF Core)**

A **navigation property** is a property in your C# class that **"navigates" to another related entity** (another table’s row).

#### **Why do we use them?**
- They represent relationships between tables (like foreign keys in a database).
- They make it easy to access related data.

#### **Simple Example:**

Suppose you have two tables: **Blog** and **Post**.

```csharp
public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    // Navigation property: a Blog has many Posts
    public List<Post> Posts { get; set; }
}

public class Post
{
    public int PostId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }

    public int BlogId { get; set; } // Foreign key

    // Navigation property: a Post belongs to one Blog
    public Blog Blog { get; set; }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `Blog.Posts` is a navigation property (it lets you get all the posts of a blog).
- `Post.Blog` is also a navigation property (it lets you get the blog a post belongs to).

#### **How are they used?**

```csharp
var blog = context.Blogs.Include(b => b.Posts).First();
```
Here, `.Posts` is a navigation property. EF Core will fetch the related posts for that blog.

## What is "Navigation" in general?

In the context of EF Core or C# **"navigation"** just means **moving from one entity/table to another through their relationships** using navigation properties.

Think of it like:
- **Blog** ⟶ **Posts** (one-to-many)
- **Post** ⟶ **Blog** (many-to-one)

You “navigate” from one object to the related one(s).

|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Navigation Property   | A C# property that lets you access related entities (tables/objects).  |
| Navigation (general)  | The act of moving through related entities using these properties.      |

**In short:**  
> **A navigation property is a C# property that points to related data (other tables/objects) in your model. "Navigation" is just following those relationships to get related data.**
