## scroll control, no wrap with `-S`

```
-S or --chop-long-lines
              Causes lines longer than the screen width to be chopped (truncated) rather than wrapped.  That is, the portion of a long line that does not fit in the screen width is not
              displayed until you press RIGHT-ARROW.  The default is to wrap long lines; that is, display the remainder on the next line.
