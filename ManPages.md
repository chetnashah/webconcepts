## How to read command invocation?

Here's a detailed guide to reading command synopsis notation in man pages:

The synopsis section uses a specific notation to describe command syntax. Let me break down the key elements:

1. **Bold Text (usually shown as plain text in man pages)**
   - Represents commands, flags, and keywords that must be typed exactly as shown
   Example: `ls`

2. **Underlined Text (usually shown in italics)**
   - Represents parameters that you replace with actual values
   Example: In `mv source destination`, you replace "source" and "destination" with actual file names

3. **Square Brackets [ ]**
   - Indicate optional items
   Example: `tar [options] files`
   This means the options are optional, but files are required

4. **Vertical Bar |**
   - Represents mutually exclusive options/parameters (meaning "OR")
   Example: `ps [-e | -A]`
   This means use either -e OR -A, but not both

5. **Ellipsis ...**
   - Indicates that the previous item can be repeated
   Example: `cp source... destination`
   This means you can specify multiple source files

Let's analyze some real examples:

1. `grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]`
   - `grep` is the command (required)
   - `[OPTIONS]` are optional
   - `PATTERN` is required
   - `[FILE...]` means zero or more files are optional

2. `find [-H|-L|-P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ... [expression]`
   - `find` is the command
   - `[-H|-L|-P]` means you can use one (and only one) of these options
   - `[-EXdsx]` are separate optional flags that can be combined
   - `path` is required
   - `...` means you can specify multiple paths
   - `[expression]` is an optional search expression

3. `ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file] [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file] [-J destination] [-L address] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec] [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-p port] [-Q query_option] [-R address] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]] destination [command]`
   - `ssh` is the command
   - All items in `[ ]` are optional
   - `-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy` are single-letter options that can be combined
   - Options like `-B`, `-b`, `-c` require additional parameters
   - `destination` is required
   - `[command]` is optional

Common Patterns to Remember:
1. Required items appear without brackets
2. `[optional]` items are in square brackets
3. `{required-choice1|required-choice2}` grouping with vertical bars means you must choose one
4. `[optional1|optional2]` means if you use this optional element, you must choose one
5. `...` means "one or more of the previous element"

More Examples of Interpretation:

```
cat [-benstuv] [file ...]
```
This means:
- `cat` is the command
- All flags `-b`, `-e`, `-n`, `-s`, `-t`, `-u`, `-v` are optional
- You can specify zero or more files

```
chown [-fhv] owner[:group] file...
```
This means:
- `chown` is the command
- `-f`, `-h`, `-v` flags are optional
- `owner[:group]` is required (with group being optional)
- You must specify at least one file, but can specify multiple files
