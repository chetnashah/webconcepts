Learning is something our industry doesn't talk about a ton. All of the tech knowledge that is in people's brains, they've learned in some way. But we donâ€™t really admit that it took time.

## Share your learnings

Show the junior people in your organisation that you're learning and how you're doing it. Be public about what you're learning.

## Staying up to date

### Newsletters

One should join newsletters for any tech stack they are working on. e.g. TS, react etc.
This way, it is easy to focus on what matters to stay up to date.
