| **Base Pointer**       | EBP                                   | FP/R11                                |
| **Link Register**      | N/A (uses stack for return addresses) | LR (R14)                              |
| **Program Counter**    | EIP                                   | PC (R15)                              |
| **Flags Register**     | EFLAGS                                | CPSR                                  |
| **Parameter Passing**  | Primarily stack-based                 | Register-based (R0-R3), then stack    |
| **Memory Access**      | Variable length instructions          | Fixed length instructions (4 bytes)   |
| **Conditional Execution** | Conditional jumps (e.g., JE, JNE)    | Conditional suffixes on instructions (e.g., EQ, NE) |
| **Addressing Modes**   | Multiple addressing modes (e.g., immediate, direct, indirect, indexed) | Limited addressing modes (e.g., immediate, indirect) |
| **Instruction Format** | Variable-length instructions          | Fixed-length instructions (32 bits)   |
| **Instruction Set**    | Large and complex instruction set    | Smaller and simpler instruction set   |
| **Pipelining**         | Less efficient pipelining due to variable-length instructions | More efficient pipelining due to fixed-length instructions |
| **Syntax**             | Intel syntax (e.g., `mov eax, 1`)    | ARM syntax (e.g., `MOV R0, #1`)       |
| **Alignment**          | Less strict on data alignment         | Stricter on data alignment            |

### Key Differences:
1. **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**:
   - x86 uses CISC, which has a large and complex instruction set.
   - ARM uses RISC, which has a smaller and simpler instruction set.

2. **Instructions**:
   - x86 instructions are variable in length.
   - ARM instructions are fixed in length (32 bits).

3. **Registers**:
   - x86 has named registers like EAX, EBX, etc.
   - ARM has numbered registers like R0, R1, etc.

4. **Conditionals**:
   - x86 uses conditional jumps (e.g., JE, JNE).
   - ARM uses conditional suffixes on instructions (e.g., EQ, NE).

5. **Parameter Passing**:
   - x86 primarily uses the stack for passing parameters.
   - ARM uses registers (R0-R3) for passing parameters, and the stack if needed.

6. **Addressing Modes**:
   - x86 has a variety of addressing modes.
   - ARM has more limited addressing modes.

7. **Pipelining**:
   - x86 has less efficient pipelining due to variable-length instructions.
   - ARM has more efficient pipelining due to fixed-length instructions.

8. **Syntax**:
   - x86 uses Intel syntax (e.g., `mov eax, 1`).
   - ARM uses its own syntax (e.g., `MOV R0, #1`).

This table should provide a clear comparison between x86 and ARM assembly, highlighting the key differences in their architectures and instruction sets.
