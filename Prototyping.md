### What is a prototype?

NO matter the medium, purpose of a prototype is to 
communicate story of product to stakeholders to get feedback.

Prototypes should be cheap, fast.

Point of prototypes is
- to be seen
- to be interacted with

### Circles of feedback
- Too close to project (Team + friends)
- Subject matter experts (not working on project) (Use internet)
- customers (Use internet)
- Customer's customer (use internet)

Questions that are useful for each stage of prototyping:

#### Low-fidelity:

- Is each main function of the app easily accessible to users?
- Do users easily identify what the functionality of the app is?
- What is getting in the way of their use of that functionality?
- What expectations do they have of potential supplemental functionality for the app?

#### Med-fidelity:

- For each screen, does the design of the screen work to guide users to the right functions?
- Does the user easily navigate through the app to find supplemental functionality?
- Do users easily find the interaction points we intend them to?

#### Hi-fidelity:

- Does the animation between each screen delight users?
- Does our use of color work to make their experience compelling?
- Do users like how the app reacts to touch gestures?
