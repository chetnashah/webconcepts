## Terminology

**A computer is a collection of drives** which (drives) can be purchased independently. Typically a laptop comes with an internal drive, and as a user I have added a USB SSD 1 TB drive. My laptop has two drives; both are SSD, but both could be HDD. When I plug in my backup drive each evening, I have three drives associated with this laptop computer.

**A drive can be divided, partitioned, into partitions.** My internal laptop SSD drive is divided into four partitions. My two external drives – the SSD and the HDD – have but one partition and these partitions are encrypted.

**A partition is a part of a drive.**

**A volume is a logical set of one or more partitions** assembled from one or more partitions of the drives available to the computer.

## macos vs linux terminology

Certainly! Comparing how macOS and Linux handle partitions and volumes can help clarify their similarities and differences, especially for users transitioning between these operating systems. Below is a comprehensive table that contrasts partitions and volumes in **macOS** versus **Linux** across various aspects:

| **Aspect**                    | **macOS**                                                                 | **Linux**                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Partition Definition**      | A distinct section of the physical drive, analogous to separate "rooms" in an apartment. | Similar to macOS, partitions are distinct sections of a physical drive, treated as separate "spaces." |
| **Volume Definition**         | A storage area within a partition, managed by the filesystem (APFS or HFS+). Can dynamically share space within an APFS container. | In Linux, a volume can refer to a mounted filesystem or a logical volume managed by Logical Volume Manager (LVM). |
| **Primary File Systems**      | - **APFS (Apple File System):** Modern, optimized for SSDs, supports features like snapshots and encryption.<br>- **HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus):** Older filesystem, used primarily for mechanical HDDs and compatibility. | - **ext4:** Most commonly used, stable and widely supported.<br>- **Btrfs:** Advanced features like snapshots and dynamic resizing.<br>- **XFS:** High-performance filesystem for large files.<br>- **Others:** FAT32, NTFS (with proper drivers), etc. |
| **Default Management Tools**  | - **Disk Utility:** GUI-based tool for managing disks, partitions, and volumes.<br>- **Terminal (`diskutil`):** Command-line tool for advanced disk operations. | - **GParted:** Popular GUI tool for partitioning.<br>- **fdisk / gdisk / parted:** Command-line tools for partition management.<br>- **LVM Tools (`lvcreate`, `vgcreate`, etc.):** For managing logical volumes. |
| **Dynamic Space Management** | **APFS Space Sharing:** Multiple APFS volumes within a single APFS container can dynamically share available space without fixed allocation. | **Logical Volume Manager (LVM):** Allows flexible allocation of disk space by creating volume groups and logical volumes that can be resized and moved as needed. |
| **Multi-Operating System Support** | - **Boot Camp:** Allows installation of Windows on a separate partition.<br>- **File System Compatibility:** Primarily APFS and HFS+; other OSes require compatible file systems or drivers. | - **Dual/Triple Booting:** Easily set up with various Linux distributions alongside other OSes like Windows.<br>- **File System Flexibility:** Supports a wide range of filesystems for interoperability. |
| **Encryption**                | - **APFS Encryption:** Native support for encrypting individual volumes with strong encryption algorithms.<br>- **FileVault:** Full-disk encryption option for macOS. | - **LUKS/dm-crypt:** Standard Linux encryption for partitions or logical volumes.<br>- **Filesystem-Level Encryption:** Some filesystems like Btrfs support encryption features. |
| **Resizing Partitions/Volumes** | - **APFS Volumes:** Can be resized dynamically within a container without impacting other volumes.<br>- **HFS+ Partitions:** Resizing is possible but less flexible compared to APFS. | - **LVM:** Easily resize logical volumes and adjust volume groups.<br>- **Standard Partitions:** Resizing may require unmounting and can be limited by filesystem constraints. |
| **Snapshots**                 | **APFS Snapshots:** Allows creating point-in-time copies of volumes for backups and system restores. | - **Btrfs and LVM Snapshots:** Provide similar snapshot capabilities for filesystems and logical volumes.<br>- **ext4:** Does not natively support snapshots; requires additional tools like LVM. |
| **Space Sharing Mechanism**   | **APFS Containers:** Serve as pools from which APFS volumes can draw space as needed, promoting efficient usage. | **LVM Volume Groups:** Act as pools of storage from which logical volumes allocate space dynamically. |
| **Terminology Differences**   | - **Container:** APFS-specific term for a group of volumes sharing space.<br>- **Volume:** Individual storage areas within a container. | - **Volume Group (VG):** Pool of physical volumes in LVM.<br>- **Logical Volume (LV):** Equivalent to macOS’s volume, carved out from a VG. |
| **User Interface**            | - **Disk Utility:** Intuitive GUI for most users.<br>- **Limited Advanced Tools:** Advanced configurations may require Terminal. | - **Variety of Tools:** Multiple GUI tools (like GParted) and comprehensive command-line utilities.<br>- **Flexibility for Advanced Users:** Greater control via command-line. |
| **Use Cases and Flexibility** | - **Simplicity:** Designed for ease of use with sensible defaults.<br>- **Limited Customization:** Less flexibility compared to Linux for complex setups. | - **High Flexibility:** Suitable for a wide range of configurations, from simple to highly customized setups.<br>- **Advanced Configurations:** Ideal for servers, custom partitions, and specialized storage needs. |
