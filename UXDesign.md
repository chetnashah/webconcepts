Make users happy and get their
stuff done without getting in the way.

Forms: magical UI that convert user/domain knowledge into database records.

Don't go into detail design early on, instead think of easier and proven ways

### Personas and use cases

Personas are the type of user/audience that you are targeting.
One must define a persona with relevant attributes e.g. "college student john" or "Working class chet".
* List down the attributes/qualities of the persona e.g.
- does not have a car
- spends money sparingly
- socially well connected

Talk to the users to get more ideas about the persona as well as use cases.

* List down the use cases based on the persona and their behavioral attributes mentioned above.
- very basic use case
- delivery available (persona does not have a car)
- coupons/discounts (persona spends money sparingly)
- share items/products to friends (persona is socially well connected)

### Use cases drive features

Based on use cases, come up with states/screens.
some e.g. 
1. not-signed-in
2. Listing
3. Checkout
4. Help
5. Homepage/dashboard
Make state machine of UI, where states would correspond to 
screens and transtions would correspond to actions like button clicks.

### Form factors add to persona's behavior
Form factors like mobile will add following attributes:
- limited data and battery
- sketchy network connection.
- smaller size of screen
- divided attention
- handedness and action/CTA placement (simple big and center)

### Some use cases will span all personas as they tend to business
- User authentication and personalization  (Sign In)
- Payment methods
- Getting Help

### Grouping elements shortcut

Select elements and `Cmd + G`

### User context
- What is your user doing? walking/running/sleeping/sitting.
- Where is your user? Where do you want him to be? At home/in transit/outside
- Who or what are they near? Landmarks/people
- Who is your user? Child/adult/ other attributes?


Write down flows, scenarios and use cases, and talk to users about them.
try to break down flows or into steps if necessary. Discuss these by making some low res wireframes.

Ask yourself if the user even needs login, e.g there is no contextual data specific to user context e.g. calculator or other utility apps, u do not need login/auth.

Ask about contextual data/login only when absolutely needed.


Improving forms:
Use existing if available, else
1. font sizes
2. place holders
3. validations
4. field input suggestions
5. minimum info required should be taken.
6. Don't ask user to fill what is already known.

Multi - step forms ?


Notifications - Use them appropriately.
Should have to the point but actionable information. 
Actions should be limited to 2-3 on the notification
