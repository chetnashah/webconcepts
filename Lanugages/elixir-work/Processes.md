Processes in Elixir are extremely lightweight in terms of memory and CPU

so, it is common to have tens or even hundreds of thousands of processes running simultaneously.

In Elixir, **all code runs inside processes. Processes are isolated from each other, run concurrent to one another and communicate via message passing.**
