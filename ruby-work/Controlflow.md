## No need of parentheses & blocks end with "end" keyword

```rb
if k > 2
    puts "k greater than 2"
end
```

## No need of semicolons

```rb
if k > 2
    puts "k greater than 2"
end
```

## unless is opposite of if, i.e. unless condition false then block executes

```rb
unless k < 0
    puts "k is positive"
end
```
