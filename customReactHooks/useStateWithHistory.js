/**
 * Design aspects:
 * 
 * inputs: initialStateValue -> primitive
 * 
 * outputs: Return array with 5 entries:
 * [currValue, setter, goBackFn, goForwardFn, historyArr]

 * Behavior aspects:
 * 
 * Will it cause a re-render without user intervention?
 * 
 * Does it have hidden state/storage from the user?
