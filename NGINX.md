Config file at:

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

### Over all structure

Directives are divided into simple directives and block directives. 

A `simple directive` consists of the name and parameters separated by spaces and ends with a semicolon (;). 

A `block directive` has the same structure as a simple directive, but instead of the semicolon it ends with a set of additional instructions surrounded by braces ({ and }). 

If a block directive can have other directives inside braces, it is called a context (examples: `events`, `http`, `server`, and `location`).

example config: (`nginx.conf`)

### http Block
The http block contains directives for handling web traffic. These directives are often referred to as universal because they are passed on to to all website configurations NGINX serves

### server block

### location block

The location setting lets you configure how NGINX will respond to requests for resources within the server.
