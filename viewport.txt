HTML5 let web designers take control of viewport through <meta> tag.

A good practice is to add first line


<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


initial scale is zoom scale, and width will be set to device width


Some other good practices :
1. do not use large fixed width elements.
2. Use css media queries to apply different styling for small and large screen.

To consider border width as a part of width of the view,
one should set
box-sizing: border-box
