## Big picture (Setting the goal)

There are often business goals standing behind a digital product. This leads to
prioritization of elements/design to fulfill that goal.

Do not start anything without knowing the goal first.

### User Research

Users means our target audience.
Users are not designers. They don't know what they need. What might be good for user might not necessarily good for the business.

Designers are not users. Designer have different mindset than users. This can result in a confirmation bias. The only way to correct the bias is to empathize with the user by looking and talking to the user.

### Design testing methodologies

### Informed design decisions via data

### Guidelines vs Creative design freedom

Guidelines usually follow from previous research. If sufficiently followed, a user will have consistent experience. A great deal of re-usability and structure present for builders/developers. tools and frameworks can be built around it.

On the other hand exploratory design is also necessary to find out new and better way of doing things.

Usability guidelines constrains design in a way that revelas the facts of the users of the word (which is a good kind of constraint).

### Scrolling behaviour: Move up or down?

Touch and scroll:
When you get control of the content, you would want to move content up, keeping the viewport fixed, to see the rest of the content. This happens with mouses and touch usually.

Arrow keys:
With arrow keys one gets control of the viewport. Pressing down, moves the viewport 
down and keeps content position fixed.

### Being native to the device environment

### Responsiveness

Design once, run everywhere designs are good. But also test everywhere since half the designs are broken, different kinds of devices have different prioritization of features. When or when not to make something visible.

### Navigational guidelines

User would always like to know where he is in the navigation, hence the breadcrumbs, the tabs etc.

### Scanning patterns

### White space is a visual element

### Apply the golden ratio

### Using the grid

### Color Choice

### Font Choice

### Design Patterns

### Easy mode vs Power Users Mode

Different set of context/settings depending on user demographic.

### Infinite scrolling

In context of scrollable views,
Infinite scrolling is a technique where a user can scroll through a massive chunk of content with no finishing line in sight. It keeps refreshing/loading items on page as the scroll end is reached.

Use cases:
1. Discovery of ocean of information
With ocean of information to discover, e.g. social media sites, it is a glitch for a page reload and breaks flow. So infinite scroll is must have feature for discovery interfaces.

2. Scrolling is better than click
Especially for mobile devices

Cons: clever engineering required to make it work efficiently. e.g. Garbage collection. difficult to move specific positions(jumping) in the list. Scrollbars are irrelevant.

### List pagination

It is the task of breaking MxN list items,
into M pages, each with N list items.
Users can be given a choice to select N(Items per page), thus affecting M(the number of pages shown)

Pagination pairs well with search, especially on websites. Not so sure on mobile.

Pros: Gives user a sense of control, can jump to specific pages(mental location), not to mention paginated links are easily sharable to any one. Jumping to some page is especially useful if he knows how content is ordered in list(e.g. sorted by some property etc.).
Application can save state easily on page where user left browsing.

Cons: extra actions. breaks flow

### MicroCopy

1. It's a short message
2. Targeted and contextual
3. Wording matters, be simple

When something goes wrong it should be known exactly what happened, descriptive/simple at a level that a user should be able to fix it.

### VonRestroff effect

Also known as the isolation effect,
one object that is different from the
rest is likely to be remembered.

This is the main  reason why Call to Action buttons etc. look different from rest of action buttons on an app.

### Serial Position effect

It is the propensity of user to best remember the first and last item in the series.

E.g. in tab bar menu, most important Items are placed first and last like Home and profile.

### Cognitive load

It is amount of thought you need to exercise in order to complete a specific task. 

#### Why we use design patterns?

“It’s easier for users to learn something new if they can discern it to a pattern from something they understand”

### Hick's Law

Hick’s Law describes that the time it takes for a person to make a decision depends on the choices available to him or her. So if the number of choices increases, the time to make a decision increases logarithmically.

### Gestalt's Laws

#### Law of proximity

Objects that are near tend to be grouped together, Mind tends to cluster naturally.
Grouping will lead the user to think they are associated together.


### Coming up with a new product

1. Should do something useful first (Business goal and market fit)
2. then make it simple.(design and test iteration)
3. then make it fast. (engineering iteration)
