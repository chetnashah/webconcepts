CSS has rules about inheritance and cascading,
in case of conflicts, some styles will take precedence over other,
and styles are inherited into children,
The order and rules in which the final styles are determined can
be found in:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance

Importance:

Specificity:
Specificity is measure of how specific a selector is.
Element selectors have lower specifity that class selectors.
So class selectors will win against element selectors,
Similarly id selectors will win against class selectors.
The only way to win against ID selector is to use !important

Source order:

If multiple competing selectors have same importance,
and same specificity, the third factor that comes into
play is source order, i.e. later rules will win over
earlier rules

e.g.
  p {
      color: blue;
  }

  p {
      color: red;
  }

will result in red color for paragraph selector

Also order of overriding as follows:

1. browser default
2. External stylesheet
3. internal stylesheet
4. inline style
