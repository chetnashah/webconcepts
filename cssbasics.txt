* About links:

  * Sometimes we want to add links, before hand knowing where they
  will link to, in which case, set href="#" also known as a dead link.

  * you can turn any dom element into link(e.g img(, by nesting them into anchor tag

* Understanding CSS border-radius:
(Find out more at https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-border/#border-radius)
Whenever we give border radius, border-radius actually takes
two values x/y (horizontal raidus/vertical radius) i.e.
```
border-radius: 12;
```
is same as
```
border-radius: 12 12;
```

So what is it look like to have different x/y radius for
border-radius?
It is a 90 degree part of ellipse, you know ellipse has two radii
so greater x/horizontal radius will result n a horiontally fatter
ellipse portion, and greater y/vertical radius is vertically longer
ellipse portion

Using percentages in border radius: percentages are calcualted
with respect to border box width for x/horizontal
and with respect to border box height for y/vertiical

Corner curves must not overlap: When the sum of any two adjacent border radii exceeds the size of the border box, UAs must proportionally reduce the used values of all border radii until none of them overlap
and
reducing the radii of the circle to half the size of the smallest side.

* CSS borders have properties like style, color and width,
which are aptly named : border-color, boder-width and border-style
e.g.
```
.thick-green-border {
  border-color: green;
  border-width: 10px;
  border-style: solid;
}
```

* give two classes to an tag using spaces in class string e.g.
```
<img class="class1 class2">
```

Note: also check to use devtools to maximize style work productivity

CSS has rules about inheritance and cascading,
in case of conflicts, some styles will take precedence over other,
and styles are inherited into children,
The order and rules in which the final styles are determined can
be found in:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance

Importance:

Specificity:
Specificity is measure of how specific a selector is.
Element selectors have lower specifity that class selectors.
So class selectors will win against element selectors,
Similarly id selectors will win against class selectors.
The only way to win against ID selector is to use !important

Source order:

If multiple competing selectors have same importance,
and same specificity, the third factor that comes into
play is source order, i.e. later rules will win over
earlier rules

e.g.
  p {
      color: blue;
  }

  p {
      color: red;
  }

will result in red color for paragraph selector

Also order of overriding as follows:

1. browser default
2. External stylesheet
3. internal stylesheet
4. inline style
