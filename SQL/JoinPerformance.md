* **Indexes**: Ensure join columns are indexed. Missing indexes can cause full table scans.
* **Join on Keys**: Prefer joining on primary/foreign keys.
* **Reduce Data Early**: Filter (WHERE) before joining to reduce intermediate row counts.
* **Avoid Functions on Join Columns**: Expressions like ON UPPER(a.col) = UPPER(b.col) prevent index use.
* **Select Only Needed Columns**: Donâ€™t use SELECT * if possible.
* **Consider Join Order**: In complex queries, SQL optimizers are smart, but reducing large intermediate results early helps.
* **Analyze Execution Plans**: Use EXPLAIN or query plan tools to see if joins are causing bottlenecks.
