It is more of an iteration instead of recursion.

## Structure

Absolutely! Here’s a **simple, memorable breakdown** of the **syntax for a recursive CTE**, highlighting its three key components: **base case**, **iteration (recursive step)**, and **termination**.

---

## **Recursive CTE Syntax Breakdown**

```sql
WITH RecursiveCTE (columns) AS (
    -- 1. Base case: the starting rows
    SELECT initial_values
    FROM source_table
    WHERE starting_condition

    UNION ALL

    -- 2. Recursive step: build on previous results
    SELECT next_values
    FROM source_table
    JOIN RecursiveCTE ON join_condition
    WHERE recursion_condition
)
-- 3. Use the CTE: termination is handled automatically by the query engine
SELECT * FROM RecursiveCTE;
```

---

### **1. Base Case ("Anchor Member")**
- **What:** The initial rows to start recursion.
- **How:** A simple `SELECT` statement.
- **Mnemonic:** “Where does my recursion begin?”

### **2. Recursive Step ("Recursive Member")**
- **What:** Refers to the CTE itself, and builds new results from previous ones.
- **How:** A `SELECT` that joins the CTE to other tables.
- **Mnemonic:** “How do I go from one step to the next?”

### **3. Termination**
- **What:** The recursion stops when the recursive step returns no new rows.
- **How:** The query engine checks after each iteration; if no new rows, recursion ends.
- **Mnemonic:** “Stop when there’s nothing left to add.”

## **Example: Employee Hierarchy (Find all subordinates of a manager)**

```sql
WITH EmployeeTree AS (
    -- 1. Base case: start with the manager
    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, Name
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL      -- or WHERE EmployeeID = @ManagerID

    UNION ALL

    -- 2. Recursive step: find employees reporting to the previous result
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID, e.Name
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN EmployeeTree et ON e.ManagerID = et.EmployeeID
)
-- 3. Use results
SELECT * FROM EmployeeTree;
```

---

## **Summary Table**

| Part            | Purpose          | Example Line                                 | What to Remember          |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Base Case**   | Start recursion  | `SELECT ... WHERE starting_condition`        | “Where do I start?”      |
| **Recursive Step** | Continue recursion | `SELECT ... JOIN CTEname ON ...`         | “How do I continue?”     |
| **Termination** | End recursion    | (automatic when no new rows are produced)    | “When to stop?”          |

---

## **Super Simple Mnemonic**

> **Start → Repeat → Stop**

- **Start** with the base case
- **Repeat** the recursive step using results so far
- **Stop** when no new rows are found

---

**In short:**  
Every recursive CTE is just **base case** `UNION ALL` **recursive step**, and it stops automatically when there’s nothing left to add.



## Common use cases (Tree/graph structures, sequences, etc.)

---

## **1. Hierarchical Data: Organizational Charts**

**Use Case:**  
Retrieve an employee’s management hierarchy (e.g., all managers above a given employee).

**Example Table:**
```text
Employees: EmployeeID | Name | ManagerID
```

**Recursive CTE Example:**
```sql
WITH OrgChart AS (
    -- Anchor member: start with the employee
    SELECT EmployeeID, Name, ManagerID, 0 AS Level
    FROM Employees
    WHERE EmployeeID = 123 -- start ID

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive member: join to find manager
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, e.ManagerID, oc.Level + 1
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN OrgChart oc ON e.EmployeeID = oc.ManagerID
)
SELECT * FROM OrgChart;
```
**Result:** All managers in the reporting chain above Employee 123.

---

## **2. Bill of Materials (Parts Explosion)**

**Use Case:**  
List all components (and subcomponents) needed for a product.

**Example Table:**
```text
Parts: PartID | ParentPartID | PartName
```

**Recursive CTE Example:**
```sql
WITH BOM AS (
    SELECT PartID, ParentPartID, PartName, 0 AS Level
    FROM Parts
    WHERE ParentPartID IS NULL -- root assembly

    UNION ALL

    SELECT p.PartID, p.ParentPartID, p.PartName, b.Level + 1
    FROM Parts p
    INNER JOIN BOM b ON p.ParentPartID = b.PartID
)
SELECT * FROM BOM;
```
**Result:** All parts making up the main product, with levels.

---

## **3. Graph Traversal: Ancestors/Descendants**

**Use Case:**  
Find all ancestor or descendant nodes in a tree structure (e.g., categories, file systems).

**Example Table:**
```text
Categories: CategoryID | ParentCategoryID | Name
```

**Get All Descendant Categories:**
```sql
WITH CategoryTree AS (
    SELECT CategoryID, ParentCategoryID, Name
    FROM Categories
    WHERE ParentCategoryID IS NULL -- start from root

    UNION ALL

    SELECT c.CategoryID, c.ParentCategoryID, c.Name
    FROM Categories c
    JOIN CategoryTree ct ON c.ParentCategoryID = ct.CategoryID
)
SELECT * FROM CategoryTree;
```

---

## **4. Path Enumeration / Path Strings**

**Use Case:**  
Build the full path for a node in a hierarchy (e.g., `/root/child/grandchild`).

**Example:**
```sql
WITH Paths AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, Name, ManagerID, CAST(Name AS VARCHAR(500)) AS Path
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, e.ManagerID, CAST(p.Path + '/' + e.Name AS VARCHAR(500))
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN Paths p ON e.ManagerID = p.EmployeeID
)
SELECT * FROM Paths;
```

---

## **5. Generating a Sequence of Numbers or Dates**

**Use Case:**  
Produce a list of dates or numbers without a dedicated sequence table.

**Generate Numbers 1–10:**
```sql
WITH Numbers AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1 FROM Numbers WHERE n < 10
)
SELECT n FROM Numbers;
```

**Generate Dates:**
```sql
WITH DateSeries AS (
    SELECT CAST('2024-01-01' AS DATE) AS dt
    UNION ALL
    SELECT DATEADD(day, 1, dt) FROM DateSeries WHERE dt < '2024-01-10'
)
SELECT dt FROM DateSeries;
```

---

## **6. Finding Cycles in a Graph**

**Use Case:**  
Detect if a graph (e.g., relationships or dependencies) contains cycles.

**Example (simplified):**
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE GraphPaths AS (
    SELECT FromNode, ToNode, CAST(FromNode AS VARCHAR(100)) AS Path, 1 AS Depth
    FROM Edges
    UNION ALL
    SELECT gp.FromNode, e.ToNode, gp.Path || ',' || e.ToNode, gp.Depth + 1
    FROM GraphPaths gp
    JOIN Edges e ON gp.ToNode = e.FromNode
    WHERE gp.Path NOT LIKE '%' || e.ToNode || '%'
)
SELECT * FROM GraphPaths WHERE Depth > 1;
```
*Adapt syntax as per your SQL dialect.*

---

## **7. Flattening Parent-Child Relationships**

**Use Case:**  
Return a flat list of all descendants of a given parent (e.g., all subfolders in a file system).

---

## **Summary Table**

| Use Case                          | What It Solves                                   |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Org chart / Employee hierarchy     | Find managers, subordinates, reporting chains    |
| Bill of Materials (BOM)            | Expand all component levels for assembly         |
| Category or folder tree            | List all ancestors/descendants                   |
| Path string construction           | Build full paths for nodes                       |
| Generate sequences                 | Numbers, dates, timespans                        |
| Detect cycles in graphs            | Data integrity, workflow validation              |
| Flatten hierarchy                  | List all items under a parent                    |

---

**In summary:**  
Recursive CTEs are ideal for any situation involving **hierarchies, parent-child relationships, or recursive data expansion**. They dramatically simplify these queries compared to procedural code or manual iteration.
