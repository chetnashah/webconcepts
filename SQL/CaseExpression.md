Absolutely, the `CASE` expression is a powerful SQL feature for conditional logic. According to SQL grammar (SQL standard, and in practice in major RDBMSs like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle), the `CASE` **expression** (not statement) can be used in **many different places** within a SQL query.

---

## **Places Where `CASE` Can Be Used**

### 1. **In the `SELECT` List**
You can use `CASE` to derive a column's value based on conditions.

```sql
SELECT
  Name,
  Salary,
  CASE 
    WHEN Salary > 100000 THEN 'High'
    WHEN Salary > 50000 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END AS SalaryCategory
FROM Employees;
```

---

### 2. **In the `WHERE` Clause**
You can use `CASE` to make conditional logic for filtering.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE
  OrderStatus = CASE 
    WHEN IsActive = 1 THEN 'Open'
    ELSE 'Closed'
  END;
```
*Note: While supported, this is less common and sometimes less efficient than logical operators.*

---

### 3. **In the `ORDER BY` Clause**
You can conditionally control sorting order.

```sql
SELECT Name, JoinDate
FROM Employees
ORDER BY
  CASE 
    WHEN IsManager = 1 THEN 1 
    ELSE 2 
  END,
  JoinDate DESC;
```

---

### 4. **In the `GROUP BY` Clause**
You can use `CASE` inside a `GROUP BY` (but not as the grouping key itself; rather within expressions):

```sql
SELECT
  CASE WHEN Salary > 50000 THEN 'Above50K' ELSE '50KOrLess' END AS SalaryGroup,
  COUNT(*)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY
  CASE WHEN Salary > 50000 THEN 'Above50K' ELSE '50KOrLess' END;
```

---

### 5. **In Aggregate Functions**
You can use `CASE` inside aggregates for conditional aggregation.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN Gender = 'F' THEN 1 END) AS FemaleEmployees
FROM Employees;
```

---

### 6. **In `HAVING` Clauses**
You can use `CASE` to apply conditional logic to filter aggregate results.

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS NumEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN Gender = 'F' THEN 1 END) > 5;
```

---

### 7. **Inside Subqueries**
You can use `CASE` in any subquery, wherever an expression is allowed.

```sql
SELECT Name
FROM (
    SELECT Name, 
           CASE WHEN Score >= 60 THEN 'Pass' ELSE 'Fail' END AS Result
    FROM Students
) t
WHERE Result = 'Pass';
```

---

### 8. **In UPDATE/SET Statements**
You can use `CASE` to update fields conditionally.

```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Bonus = 
    CASE 
        WHEN PerformanceRating = 'A' THEN 1000
        WHEN PerformanceRating = 'B' THEN 500
        ELSE 100
    END;
```

---

### 9. **In INSERT Statements**
When using `INSERT ... SELECT`, you can use `CASE` in the SELECT part to compute values.

```sql
INSERT INTO HighEarners (EmployeeName, BonusLevel)
SELECT Name,
       CASE WHEN Salary > 100000 THEN 'Tier 1' ELSE 'Tier 2' END
FROM Employees;
```

## **Summary Table**

| Place               | Example Use of CASE                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| SELECT list         | Derived/conditional columns         |
| WHERE clause        | Conditional filtering              |
| ORDER BY clause     | Conditional sorting                |
| GROUP BY clause     | Conditional grouping expressions   |
| Aggregate functions | Conditional counting/summing       |
| HAVING clause       | Conditional aggregate filtering    |
| Subqueries          | Any expression context             |
| UPDATE/SET          | Conditional updates                |
| INSERT ... SELECT   | Conditional values for insert      |

## **Key Point**

> The `CASE` expression can be used **anywhere an expression is valid** in SQL.
