CTEs are named and reusable temporary result sets, while subqueries are nested queries within another query. 
---

## **What is a Subquery?**

A **subquery** is a query nested inside another SQL query. It can appear in `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, or `HAVING` clauses.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID IN (
    SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE Location = 'NY'
);
```

---

## **What is a CTE (Common Table Expression)?**

A **CTE** is a named temporary result set, defined using the `WITH` keyword, that exists only during the execution of a single query.

**Example:**
```sql
WITH NYDepartments AS (
    SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE Location = 'NY'
)
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM NYDepartments);
```

## **Key Differences**

| Feature                | CTE                                           | Subquery                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Syntax**             | `WITH CTEName AS ( ... )`                     | Query within `SELECT`, `FROM`, etc.    |
| **Readability**        | More readable, especially for complex logic   | Can become hard to read if nested      |
| **Reusability**        | Can reference the CTE multiple times          | Must repeat logic for each use         |
| **Recursion**          | Supports recursion (recursive CTEs)           | Does not support recursion             |
| **Performance**        | Often similar, but CTEs can be optimized      | Generally equivalent in many cases     |
| **Scope**              | Valid for the single statement following `WITH`| Only within the enclosing query        |
| **Nesting**            | Can define multiple CTEs, chain them          | Can nest subqueries, can get complex   |

---

## **Use Cases**

- **Subquery:**  
  - Simple filtering (e.g., `WHERE IN (SELECT ...)`)
  - Scalar value retrieval (e.g., `SELECT (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees)`)

- **CTE:**  
  - Complex transformations
  - Reusing the same logic multiple times in one query
  - Recursive operations (e.g., traversing hierarchies)
  - Improving clarity of multi-step queries

---

## **Practical Example: Reusing Logic**

Suppose you want to use the same set of filtered employees twice:

**With CTE:**
```sql
WITH FilteredEmployees AS (
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000
)
SELECT Name FROM FilteredEmployees
UNION ALL
SELECT ManagerName FROM FilteredEmployees;
```

**With Subquery:**
```sql
SELECT Name FROM (
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000
) AS FilteredEmployees
UNION ALL
SELECT ManagerName FROM (
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000
) AS FilteredEmployees;
```
*In the subquery version, the filter logic is repeated.*

| Aspect         | CTE                                   | Subquery              |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Naming         | Yes                                   | No                    |
| Multiple Use   | Yes                                   | No                    |
| Recursion      | Yes                                   | No                    |
| Readability    | Better for complex queries            | Good for simple cases |

**In summary:**  
- Use **CTEs** for complex, multi-step, or recursive logic and for improved readability.
- Use **subqueries** for simple, one-off conditions or when brevity is preferred.

Absolutely! Here’s a **support matrix** for **CTEs** and **subqueries** across major relational databases, plus a few notes about each system:

## **Practical Recommendations**

- **If you’re using MySQL older than 8.0:**  
  - CTEs *not* available, use subqueries or temp tables instead.
- **For all other modern RDBMSs:**  
  - Both CTEs and subqueries are fully supported and interchangeable.
- **Recursive CTEs:**  
  - Check version if on Oracle or MySQL.
