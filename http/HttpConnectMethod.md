HTTPS CONNECT tunneling is simply a way for an HTTP client (e.g. your browser) to ask an HTTP proxy to open a raw TCP “pipe” to a destination host:port—that pipe then carries the client’s TLS handshake and encrypted data end‑to‑end, without the proxy ever looking inside.

**The CONNECT method asks a tunnel gateway to create a TCP connection to an arbitrary destination server and port and to blindly relay subsequent data between client and server which is commonly used for transparent proxies**

Okay, let's break down the HTTP `CONNECT` method. You are correct that typical application code making high-level HTTP requests (like fetching a webpage or calling a REST API) almost never explicitly creates or sends a `CONNECT` request itself.

Here's who triggers it and when:

1.  **Who Triggers It:**
    *   It's typically triggered by the **HTTP client software** being used. This could be:
        *   A **web browser** (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
        *   An **HTTP client library** used within your application (like `requests` in Python, `HttpClient` in Java/.NET, `fetch` API in JavaScript environments, `curl` command-line tool).
        *   The **operating system's networking stack** under certain proxy configurations.

2.  **When It's Triggered:**
    *   The primary use case is when the client needs to establish a **secure end-to-end connection (like HTTPS) through an HTTP proxy**.
    *   **Scenario:**
        1.  Your application (or browser) wants to connect to a secure server, e.g., `https://example.com` (which uses port 443 by default).
        2.  Your system or application is configured to route its HTTP/HTTPS traffic through an **HTTP proxy server** (e.g., `proxy.mycompany.com:8080`).
        3.  An HTTP proxy normally only understands standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) and works at the application layer. It cannot simply forward encrypted TLS/SSL traffic because it wouldn't know where to send it without decrypting it (which would break the end-to-end security).
        4.  To handle this, the client software (browser/library) first sends an HTTP `CONNECT` request *to the proxy server*. This request essentially asks the proxy: "Please open a direct TCP connection (a tunnel) to the target server (`example.com`) on the specified port (`443`), and then just blindly forward data between me and that server."
        5.  The `CONNECT` request looks something like this (sent to the proxy):
            ```http
            CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
            Host: example.com:443
            User-Agent: [Client's User Agent]
            Proxy-Authorization: [Credentials if required by proxy]
            ```
        6.  If the proxy allows the connection (based on its configuration rules), it establishes the TCP connection to `example.com:443`. Once successful, it sends back a `200 Connection established` response to the client.
        7.  From this point on, the proxy server simply acts as a TCP relay, forwarding all raw bytes between the client and the target server (`example.com`).
        8.  Now that the tunnel is established, the client initiates the **TLS handshake** directly with `example.com` *through* the tunnel. The proxy doesn't see or interfere with the encrypted HTTPS traffic that follows.

    *   **Other Uses:** While less common for typical web browsing/API calls, `CONNECT` can also be used to tunnel other protocols (like SSH, FTP, or WebSockets (`wss://`)) through an HTTP proxy.

**Why Application Code Doesn't Explicitly Call It:**

High-level HTTP client libraries and browsers provide an abstraction layer. When you ask them to fetch `https://example.com` and they know a proxy is configured, they automatically handle the `CONNECT` negotiation with the proxy *before* proceeding with the actual secure connection establishment and the intended request (like a `GET` request for the webpage). Your application code just deals with the final URL and request details, not the underlying proxy tunneling mechanism.

In summary: The `CONNECT` method is triggered **by the HTTP client software (browser, library)**, **when it needs to establish a tunneled connection (most often for HTTPS) through an HTTP proxy**. Your application code doesn't call it directly because this low-level proxy negotiation is handled transparently by the underlying client implementation.

## 1. The HTTP CONNECT method

1.  You configure your browser to use `proxy.example.com:8080` for HTTPS.  
2.  When you visit `https://api.example.org`, the browser does:  
    ```
    CONNECT api.example.org:443 HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.example.org:443
    Proxy‑Authorization: Basic …
    ```
3.  The proxy says:
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 Connection Established\r\n
    \r\n
    ```
4.  **At that point** the HTTP proxy has opened a TCP socket to `api.example.org:443`.  
5.  **Everything from now on** (the TLS ClientHello, certificates, encrypted application data) just flows through that tunnel—proxy neither decrypts nor re‑encrypts.

---

## 2. Why no certificate is needed

Because the proxy never pretends to be the remote server and never terminates TLS. It just shovels encrypted bytes back and forth:

- The browser will perform its TLS handshake straight with `api.example.org` over the proxied TCP connection.  
- The proxy is a “blind repeater” of bytes.

Only if the proxy wanted to do a **man‑in‑the‑middle** (MITM)—that is, terminate the client’s TLS, inspect or modify it, then open a separate TLS to the upstream—would it need to present a certificate that the browser trusts.

---

## 3. Node’s `server.on('connect', …)` handler

Under the hood, Node’s HTTP server watches for incoming requests whose method is `CONNECT`.  You can hook them like this:

```js
const http = require('http');
const net  = require('net');

const proxy = http.createServer(/* optional: handle normal HTTP here */);

proxy.on('connect', (req, clientSocket, head) => {
  // 1. req.url === "api.example.org:443"
  const [host, port] = req.url.split(':');

  // 2. Open a TCP connection to the requested host:port
  const serverSocket = net.connect(port, host, () => {
    // 3. Tell the client “OK, tunnel is up”
    clientSocket.write('HTTP/1.1 200 Connection Established\r\n\r\n');

    // 4. If there's any buffered data, forward it
    if (head && head.length) serverSocket.write(head);

    // 5. Pipe data bi‑directionally
    serverSocket.pipe(clientSocket);
    clientSocket.pipe(serverSocket);
  });

  // 6. Always handle errors so your proxy doesn't crash
  const onError = err => {
    console.error('Tunnel error', err.message);
    clientSocket.end();
    serverSocket.end();
  };
  clientSocket.on('error', onError);
  serverSocket.on('error', onError);
});

proxy.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log('HTTP/HTTPS proxy listening on port 8080');
});
```

Step by step:

1.  **Receive** the `CONNECT host:port HTTP/1.1` request.  
2.  **`net.connect`** to that host and port, giving you a raw TCP socket (`serverSocket`).  
3.  **Reply** `200 Connection Established` on the `clientSocket`.  
4.  **Pipe** `clientSocket ↔ serverSocket`: from now on neither side interprets the bytes—they’re simply forwarded.  

---

## 4. Summary

- **HTTPS CONNECT** is not HTTPS forking by the proxy; it’s a request to open a transparent TCP tunnel.  
- The proxy never terminates or inspects TLS, so it needs **no TLS certificate** of its own.  
- Node’s built‑in `http` server emits a `"connect"` event when it sees a CONNECT request; you then use `net.connect` + `socket.pipe()` to implement the tunnel.
