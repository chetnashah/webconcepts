Drivers are simply Node.js classes that extend a special class included in Appium, called `BaseDriver`

## Example drivers

1. `xcuitest` - for ios https://github.com/appium/appium-xcuitest-driver
2. `espresso` and `uiautomator` for android - https://github.com/appium/appium-espresso-driver and https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver
3. `chorme` driver - https://github.com/appium/appium-chromium-driver

## Where do drivers run?

Usually on your laptop as they are node.js libraries.
