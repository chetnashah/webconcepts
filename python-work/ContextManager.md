## 

a context manager is an object that defines the methods `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`, allowing it to be used with the `with statement`. 

Context managers are commonly used to set up and tear down resources, such as acquiring and releasing file handles, database connections, or network sockets, in a clean and efficient way.

```py
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context")
        # Resource setup or any initialization code goes here
        return self  # This can be any value you want to make available in the 'as' clause

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting the context")
        # Resource cleanup or any finalization code goes here
        # The arguments provide information about any exception that occurred within the 'with' block
        if exc_type is not None:
            print(f"Exception: {exc_type}, {exc_value}")

# Using the context manager with the 'with' statement
with MyContextManager() as cm:
    print("Inside the context")
    # Code that uses the acquired resource goes here

# Once the block is exited, the context manager's __exit__ method is automatically called

# Entering the context
# Inside the context
# Exiting the context
```
