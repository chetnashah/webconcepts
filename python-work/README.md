You can check it by `print(sys.path)`

## What is site-packages?

The `site-packages` directory in Python is a location where third-party packages (libraries or modules) are installed. When you use tools like pip to install Python packages, they are typically installed into the `site-packages` directory. 

This directory is part of the Python installation and is used to store globally accessible Python packages that can be used by any Python script or application on the system.
