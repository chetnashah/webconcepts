### Dashboard

`sls dashboard`

### Serverless plugins

A Plugin is custom Javascript code that creates new or extends existing commands within the Serverless Framework. The Serverless Framework is merely a group of Plugins that are provided in the core. If you or your organization have a specific workflow, install a pre-written Plugin or write a plugin to customize the Framework to your needs. External Plugins are written exactly the same way as the core Plugins.
