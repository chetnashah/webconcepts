## What is SLO?

Determine if a perf measurement (or set of measurements)
is meeting its target percentage over a rolling time window of 7, 30 or 90 days.

e.g. `uptime` of discount service should be 99.9% in a 7 day period.

### You can use metrics and monitors as service level indicators (SLIs) to measure SLOs
