Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.


Ninja is intended to be used with a separate program generating its input files. The generator program (like the ./configure found in autotools projects) 

## Usage with a smarter build system

Ninjaâ€™s benefit comes from using it in conjunction with a smarter meta-build system.

### gn
The meta-build system used to generate build files for Google Chrome and related projects (v8, node.js), as well as Google Fuchsia. gn can generate Ninja files for all platforms supported by Chrome.


### CMake
A widely used meta-build system that can generate Ninja files on Linux as of CMake version 2.8.8. Newer versions of CMake support generating Ninja files on Windows and Mac OS X too.

### others
Ninja ought to fit perfectly into other meta-build software like premake. If you do this work, please let us know!


## Running Ninja

Ninja always runs in the build directory. 

All commands Ninja runs are run from the root of the build directory. The common thing is `ninja -C build-dir`.
