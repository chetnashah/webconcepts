### Setup

`next` is dependency.
Webpack hmr is built into framework.
Server rendererd by default.

Auto creates a `.next` directory at the project level : contains app bundles and scaffolding.

Route level Page UI goes inside a `pages` directory.
Reusable UI components should go inside a `components` directory (conventionally), you can name it anything you like. 

The only specially named directory is the `pages` directory.


Filenames in `pages` become the routes.
