## No need of useMemo

https://blog.logrocket.com/rethinking-hooks-memoization/

1. **Same reference and inexpensive operations** - if "create" function is inexpensive, and returns a primitive value, then useMemo is not needed, it will automatically prevent re-renders.
2. **Memoizing default state for any number of reasons** - basically `useState` itself stores its state in closures, so it does not need caching of startState provided by useMemo.
3. **Using `useMemo` for referential equalities** - e.g. `useMemo(() => [1, 2, 3], [])` would create array once and hold on to that reference/identity across multiple renders. `useRef` is a much better use case.


## When should you suppress hooks linting?

```js
function Example ({ impressionTracker, propA, propB, propC }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // ðŸ‘‡Track initial impression
    impressionTracker(propA, propB, propC)
  }, [])

  return <BeautifulComponent propA={propA} propB={propB} propC={propC} />                 
}
```

you donâ€™t care whether the props change or not. Youâ€™re only interested in invoking the track function with whatever the initial props are. Thatâ€™s how impression tracking works. 

You only call the impression track function when the component mounts. The difference here is you need to call the function with some initial props.
